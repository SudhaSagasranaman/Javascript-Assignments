9, What is the difference between let, var, and const in JavaScript?
“let” is a block-level scope variable. Its value can be accessed inside the block and cannot be accessed outside the block. It can be reassigned but cannot be redeclared in the same block.
“var” is a function-scope variable. Its value can be accessed inside and outside the block. It can be redeclared and reassigned.”
“const” is a constant variable whose value will not change at any time. It cannot be reassigned or redeclared and it’s a block -level scope variable.
